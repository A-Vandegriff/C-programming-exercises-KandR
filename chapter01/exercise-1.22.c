/*++****************************************************************************
  Write a program to "fold" long input lines into two or more shorter lines
  after the last non-blank character that occurs before the n-th column of
  input. Make sure your program does something intelligent with very long
  lines, and if there are no blanks or tabs before the specified column.
*******************************************************************************/
//after last non-blank means a space between two words located right after the last non-blank
//if the word (no blanks) passes through nth col, need to pick a fold spot (nth col)
//for super long inputs the program should keep folding
